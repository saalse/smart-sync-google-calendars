# Smart Sync Google Calendars

A free, secure, and unlimited solution to sync multiple Google calendars into one unified "Busy Time" calendar using Google Apps Script.

## Why This Project?

**The Problem:** Active lifestyle, flexible schedule, remote work culture. When you have multiple calendar accounts (I'm juggling 4 at the moment, so I know what I'm talking about), sharing real availability becomes a mess. You need automation that shows your actual busy/free time to both family and teammates without compromising privacy or flexibility.

**Why Not Calendly and other SaaS Solutions?**
- 🔒 **Privacy concerns** - Full calendar access to third parties. You have to pray they don't sell your data and actually care about security (usually, they don't)
- 🔗 **Not native** - Recipients must click external links instead of seeing your schedule directly in their calendar
- 📧 **Single calendar limitation** - Must choose one "main" calendar for invitations, losing flexibility
- 💰 **You have to pay** for simple feature just for syncing busy/free time

**Why Not Zapier?**
Complex setup, recurring costs, and limitations when Google Calendar API + Apps Script natively supports everything for free.

**How I Got Here:**  
After trying everything, I found [Sync Multiple Google Calendars by karbassi](https://github.com/karbassi/sync-multiple-google-calendars). Loved the concept, but it wasn't suitable for active life with many events and far-ahead planning culture. The delete-and-recreate approach was hitting Google's API limits daily. 

So I used Cursor to completely rewrite the algorithm, making it sync each event individually on create/change/delete. Now it handles any busy bee schedule within API limitations. 

## Key Features

- ✅ **Smart sync by changes only** - Updates, creates, or deletes only what changed
- ✅ **Year-ahead syncing that works** - 365 days future without hitting API limits
- ✅ **Multiple source calendars** - Sync from unlimited calendars simultaneously
- ✅ **Fast & efficient** - < 30 seconds typical runtime, uses batch API requests
- ✅ **Event-based triggers** - Syncs automatically when calendars update (near-instant)
- ✅ **Smart filtering** - Skips "free" events, preserves locations
- ✅ **Free & unlimited** - No third-party services or subscriptions
- ✅ **Duplicate Prevention**: Handles concurrent executions safely with LockService
- ✅ **Timezone independent** - Works regardless of where you travel
- ✅ **Developer-friendly** - Open source, well-documented, CLI setup for AI agents

### Privacy & Security

- ✅ **No data sharing**: Events never leave your Google account
- ✅ **Privacy-focused** - Runs entirely in your Google account, no external servers
- ✅ **You're in control**: Open source, modify as needed
- ✅ **Secure by default**: Uses Google's OAuth for authentication

## Getting Started

- **[CLI-Based Setup](./docs/setup-cli-based.md)** ← For developers who want local editing and Git workflow, with [clasp](https://github.com/google/clasp), the Apps Script CLI to streamline development with AI coding agents.


## How Smart Sync Works

The sync uses an intelligent update approach that only modifies events that have actually changed:

1. **Trigger fires** when any source calendar updates (or on schedule)
2. **Fetch phase**: Get events from all source calendars and the busy calendar
3. **Compare phase**: Match events using tracking metadata and compare content
4. **Categorize phase**: Events are categorized as:
   - **Create**: New events that don't exist yet
   - **Update**: Existing events that have changed (title, time, location, etc.)
   - **Delete**: Events removed from source calendars
   - **Skip**: Unchanged events (no API calls needed)
5. **Execute phase**: Only create, update, or delete events that actually changed
6. **Done**: Changes appear in target calendar with minimal API usage

### What Gets Synced

| Data | Synced? | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| Event title | ✅ Yes | With prefix like `[personal]` |
| Start/end time | ✅ Yes | Preserves original timezone |
| Location | ✅ Yes | For context |
| Conference links | ✅ Yes | Zoom, Meet, etc. |
| Description | ❌ No | Privacy |
| Attendees | ❌ No | Privacy |
| Free/transparent events | ❌ No | Not shown as busy |

### Technical Implementation Details

For developers interested in how the smart sync works under the hood:

- **Event Tracking**: Uses Google Calendar's `extendedProperties.private` to store:
  - `sourceCalendarId` - Which source calendar the event came from
  - `sourceEventId` - Original event ID in the source calendar
  - `sourceLastModified` - Timestamp for tracking changes
  - `syncVersion` - Schema version for future compatibility

- **Matching Logic**: Creates composite keys (`calendarId:eventId`) to match source events with synced events, enabling O(1) lookups during comparison

- **Change Detection**: Compares these fields to determine if an update is needed:
  - Title (with calendar prefix like `[personal]`)
  - Start/end times (including `dateTime`, `date`, and `timeZone`)
  - Location
  - Conference data (Zoom, Meet links, etc.)

- **Duplicate Prevention**: Multi-layer deduplication strategy:
  - Content-based hashing (calendar + time + title + location)
  - In-memory deduplication during categorization
  - Live calendar queries for concurrent execution safety

- **Error Handling**: Calendar access failures (permissions revoked, calendar deleted) are caught and logged. Events from inaccessible calendars remain in the busy calendar until access is restored, preventing accidental deletion.

- **Pagination Support**: Handles calendars with 2,500+ events by processing multiple pages of results from the Calendar API
